## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements
Neovim Stable release and up (Have not tested how far back this works).
## üöÄ Usage
#### `:Block` Toggle current buffer
#### `:BlockOn` On current buffer
#### `:BlockOff` Off current buffer

## üì¶ Installation
### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{
    "HampusHauffman/block.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("block").setup({})
    end
},
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration / Setup
To change the defaults you can change any of the following values: 
```lua
---@field percent number  -- The change in color. 0.8 would change each box to be 20% darker than the last and 1.2 would be 20% brighter.
---@field depth number -- De depths of changing colors. Defaults to 4. After this the colors reset. Note that the first color is taken from your "Normal" highlight so a 4 is 3 new colors.
---@field automatic boolean -- Automatically turns this on when treesitter finds a parser for the current file.
---@field colors string [] | nil -- A list of colors to use instead. If this is set percent and depth are not taken into account.

    require("block").setup({
        percent = 0.8,
        depth = 4,
        colors = nil,
        automatic = false,
--        colors = {
--            "#ff0000"
--            "#00ff00"
--            "#0000ff"
--        }
    })
```

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Motivation
This plugin is something i've wanted for a while but havent found any previous implementation of in neovim. 
My hope is it will help with legibility in deeply nested code.

## üìù Todo
* Bug test and fix any community found issues
* Add vim docs for usage
* Handle multi character characters such as emojis
* Potentially add virtual lines as a means to improve visibility even more

This is an example of manually set colors.

### Contribution
I will try to fix any issues found and welcome any PR for improvment of the plugin!
