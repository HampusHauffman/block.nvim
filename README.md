## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements
Neovim Stable release and up (Have not tested how far back this works).
## üöÄ Usage
#### `:Block` Toggle current buffer
#### `:BlockOn` On current buffer
#### `:BlockOff` Off current buffer

## üì¶ Installation
### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{
    "HampusHauffman/block.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("block").setup({
            percent = 0.8,
            depth = 4,
        })
    end
},
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration / Setup
Defaults: 
```lua
---@field percent number  -- The change in color. 0.8 would change each box to be 20% darker than the last and 1.2 would be 20% brighter
---@field depth number -- De depths of changing colors. Defaults to 4. After this the colors reset. Note that the first color is taken from your "Normal" highlight so a 4 is 3 new colors
---@field colors string [] | nil -- A list of colors to use instead. if this is not nil depth and percent are not used

    require("block").setup({
        percent = 0.8,
        depth = 4,
        colors = nil
--        colors = {
--            "#ff0000"
--            "#00ff00"
--            "#0000ff"
--        }
    })
```
Currently there is no config options.
You can turn this on by default with an aucmd:
```lua
vim.cmd([[
  augroup BionicAutocmd
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType * Bionic
  augroup END
]])
```

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Motivation
This plugin is something i've wanted for a while but havent found any previous implementation of in neovim. 
My hope is it will help with legibility in deeply nested code.
There is [Blockman](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leodevbro.blockman) for VsCode which however.

## üìù Todo
* Bug test and fix any community found issues
* Add vim docs for usage
* Handle multi character characters such as emojis

This is an example of manually set colors.
